README for CA Gateway Tests
===========================

This is an embedded TOP structure.
By default, it is being used as part of the CA Gateway sources.
You can also copy it out of the CA Gateway source tree and use it
separately. In that case, you will have to set the pointers in
.../configure/RELEASE appropriately.

pyTestsApp
----------

Python unit tests.
Default settings are in the gwtests.py configuration file.

Most of the tests start an EPICS (soft) IOC and a CA Gateway,
working on different non-standard ports on the 'localhost' loopback interface,
The Gateway uses an ALIAS directive to export the channels on the IOC using
a different prefix.
The test routines, using the pyepics binding, have access to both the IOC and
the Gateway channels to set up subscriptions, trigger events on the IOC and
check the resulting event streams through the Gateway.

There are two main ways to run the tests:
1. As part of the EPICS Build system 'make runtests' and 'make tapfiles'
   targets:
   Test files are copied to the O.<arch> directory and run there.
   The build system sets all necessary environment variables.
   For 'make tapfiles' the tap.py module is used to create TAP output.
2. Manually:
   Test can be run in the pyTestApp directory using the 'runTests.py' wrapper.
   You have to set EPICS_HOST_ARCH and TOP (to find the gateway executable
   under test).
   
Prerequisite python packages:
argparse      - command line argument parser
tap.py        - Test runner creating TAP output
pyepics (v3)  - Python CA client library
